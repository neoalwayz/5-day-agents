Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

Juggling multiple functionalities, coordinating intricate processes, and ensuring seamless integration can feel like a constant battle. But what if there was a way to break down these giants into manageable, intelligent \"workers\"? Enter Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) – a revolutionary approach that's poised to transform how we build software, and it’s time you learned how to harness its power.\n\n---\n\n**1. Tackling Complexity Head-On: Divide and Conquer with Intelligence**\n\n*   **Modularization and Specialization:** MAS breaks down large, monolithic systems into smaller, independent agents, each responsible for a specific task or domain. This makes development, testing, and maintenance significantly more manageable.\n*   **Distributed Problem Solving:** Instead of a single, complex algorithm, problems are distributed among agents. Each agent can focus on its specialized area, leading to more efficient and robust solutions, especially for large-scale or distributed challenges.\n*   **Adaptability and Resilience:** If one agent encounters an issue or fails, the system can often continue to function by rerouting tasks or relying on other agents. This inherent redundancy makes MAS systems highly resilient to failures.\n\n**2. Enhanced Efficiency and Performance: Smarter, Faster, Better**\n\n*   **Parallel Processing Power:** Agents can operate concurrently, performing tasks in parallel. This dramatically speeds up processing times and improves overall system throughput, especially for data-intensive or real-time applications.\n*   **Optimized Resource Utilization:** Agents can dynamically adapt their resource usage based on demand and availability, leading to more efficient allocation of computational power, memory, and network bandwidth.\n*   **Intelligent Coordination and Negotiation:** Agents can communicate, coordinate their actions, and even negotiate with each other to achieve collective goals. This intelligent collaboration leads to optimized outcomes that would be difficult to achieve with traditional programming methods.\n\n**3. Building More Intelligent and Flexible Software**\n\n*   **Autonomous Decision-Making:** Agents possess a degree of autonomy, enabling them to make decisions and take actions based on their perception of the environment and their internal goals. This allows for more proactive and adaptive software behavior.\n*   **Learning and Evolution:** Advanced MAS can incorporate machine learning capabilities, allowing agents to learn from their experiences and improve their performance over time. This leads to systems that can evolve and adapt to changing requirements.\n*   **Simulating Complex Real-World Scenarios:** MAS is particularly powerful for modeling and simulating complex systems, from traffic control and supply chains to financial markets and biological processes, offering invaluable insights for software development.\n\n---\n\n**Concluding Thought:**\n\nThe era of monolithic, single-threaded software is rapidly evolving. By embracing Multi-Agent Systems, developers can move beyond simply writing code and start orchestrating intelligent, collaborative entities. This paradigm shift promises not only more efficient and robust applications but also opens the door to building truly intelligent, adaptive, and responsive software that can tackle the challenges of tomorrow.

The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-13T12:32:50.355518Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-13T12:32:50.355808Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-13T12:32:50.361149Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-13T12:32:50.355781Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-13T12:32:50.360237Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

The lamp's beam outside suddenly felt… ordinary.\nCriticAgent > This is a promising start to a story, with a strong sense of atmosphere and an intriguing mystery. However, to make it even more compelling, consider these suggestions:\n\n1.  **Deepen Elias's internal conflict:** While the story mentions a storm brewing \"within him,\" it would be more impactful to hint at the *source* of this internal turmoil. What does Elias yearn for, or what is he escaping from, that makes this star map so disruptive? A brief flashback or a more direct internal thought could add significant emotional weight. For example, \"For twenty years, the Solitary Rock lighthouse had been his world, a deliberate isolation he’d clung to since the loss at sea. Tonight, however, a storm brewed not just outside, but within him, a long-dormant ache stirred by the sea’s offering.\"\n\n2.  **Enhance the sensory experience of the map:** The description of the map is good, but lean into Elias's reaction more. How does the \"forgotten hum\" *feel*? Is it a physical vibration, a sound only he can hear, or a deep sense of recognition? Expanding on the tactile and auditory (even if imagined) experience will make the map's magic more tangible. For instance, \"He traced a finger over the glowing lines, and a forgotten hum, deep and resonant like an ancient song, vibrated through his bones, a sensation so profound it made his teeth ache.\"\n\n3.  **Foreshadow the map's potential:** The ending suggests a shift in Elias's perception, but it could be even stronger by hinting at the *implications* of the map. What does the \"single, radiant point\" represent? Does it call to him? Does it promise escape, discovery, or danger? A subtle addition to the final sentence could leave the reader with more questions and anticipation. For example, \"The lamp's beam outside suddenly felt… ordinary, a pale imitation of the cosmic beckoning now held in his hands.\"\nRefinerAgent > Elias polished the Fresnel lens, the rhythmic sweep of light a familiar balm.
